# Tumblr-SingleA
The Single A tumblr theme introduces two new features: the sticky post and featured posts. It is a simple, but super customizable free theme.

## Sticky Post

With Single A you have the ability to “stick” one post at the top of your blog regardless of the date and time of the post.

Let’s say you always want to display at the top of your blog:

* An “About Me” post
* Your most recent original long-form blog post
* An introductory video
* A quote that you live by, or
* An advertisement

The sticky post feature allows you to do any of these things. With the sticky tag you can highlight whatever you want in your blog’s top spot.

Here’s how you set it up: In the appearance options, define the sticky tag and use that tag on the post that you would like to always display at the top of your blog. The most recent blog post with the sticky tag will always appear at the top.

## Featured Posts/Tag

The featured tag enables you to display the five most recent posts of a specific tag in the right sidebar. Similar in layout to the Likes display, the featured tag display allows bloggers to display their five most recent original articles, musicians or music lovers to display their five most recent audio tracks, or photographers to display their five most recent photographs. In short, it’s designed to give you an opportunity to highlight your featured posts long after they have fallen off the first page of your blog.

To enable the featured tag, all you have to do within the appearance options is:

* Insert a tag in the featured tag text box
* Use that tag on at least one post
* Define the label for the featured heading

The sticky post and featured tag are just two of the many features that Single A offers.

You can add social media links; control the color of several styles; upload a custom logo or image; display likes, recent tweets, and group blog features; and incorporate the Disqus commenting platform and Google Analytics.
